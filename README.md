## National Park blog - a place for people to publicly post about their experiences and recommendations for others.

**The Index View shows all entries that have been submitted, ordered by date posted (most recent at the top).**

**The Add View allows users to post a new experience. We track the person's name, the name of the national park, date/time posted (automatically tracked), and the text field where they can describe their experience. I used ModelForm to take in the user's input.**
